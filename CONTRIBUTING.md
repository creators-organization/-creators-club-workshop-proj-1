# Contributing

## Requirements

1. [ ] Install [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - If you're not comfortable with the terminal just yet, get one of:
	1. [Git's official UI](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui) - It's built in.
	2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git) - It's built in to the world's most used text editor. 
	3. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - Super nice GUI, it's free if you're a student.
	4. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - GitHub's official client, not advanced, but hard to mess up in.
	5. [...more guis](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
2. [ ] Install [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/)
  - You can also install it through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/)
3. [ ] Get a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account

### Optional

- [ ] Come over the [Discord](https://discord.gg/G3EU75Wsrg)
- [ ] Become a [Creator's Org GitHub member](https://github.com/orgs/creators-organization/people)
  - You can also create pull requests if you're not a member, but as a member you get push access :D
- [ ] Come take a look at [our documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/invite/13W9jvIa8vITgHsCIEeciws/)
- [ ] Go through [Godot's documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)

## Setup

1. [ ] Clone the repo and switch to the dev branch, `git clone -b dev https://github.com/creators-organization/workshop-proj-1.git`
2. [ ] Add your name to [CONTRIBUTORS.md]
3. [ ] Using Godot's menu, import the Project

You are now all set!

## Notes

1. When working on simple tasks related to documentation feel free to work out of the `main` branch
2. If you are touching code, switch to the `dev` branch first
3. If you are working on a multi-step task (or if you dont have push access), create a `dev/feature-name` branch first, and the pull request merge into `dev`, we will try to go through pull requests together as a team
