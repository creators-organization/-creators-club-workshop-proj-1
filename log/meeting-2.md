# Meeting 2

There is no meeting 1 document since no work was done just yet. Here we can add information which may not be obvious from the code or from the editor. In other words, welcome to our project blog :D

If you are wondering who edited any part of this blog, remember that [git blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) exists.

As there is no precedent, we'll be assuming the writer is any one of the developers (or artists), and will be written from that perspective.

---

For collaboration, issues, or the GitHub's collaboration thing or any document will not be used while we still have a small scale. But we'll try to standarize as soon as needed.
